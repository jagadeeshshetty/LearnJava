# Arrays Summary
- Simplest data structure.
- Static
    - In Java Arrays can't grow/shrink automatically.
    - In JavaScript or Python, arrays are dynamic(grow/shrink automatically).
- ArrayList
    - Java provides dynamic support to Array through ArrayList collection class.
    - Each time ArrayList grows, it'll increase 50% of it's size.
- Great when you know how many items you store in an array.
